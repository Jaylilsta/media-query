      <h2 class="card-title">Beauty & bliss </h2>
      <h3>An untold story </h3>
      <p class="card-text">In the heart of the city, where dreams unfold,
        A young black gentleman, his story untold.
        Chelsea's affection, like a gentle embrace,
        Yet within his soul, a tumultuous space.

        His skin, a canvas, rich in ebony hue,
        A tale of strength, resilience, and breakthrough.
        In Chelsea's gaze, love's tender flame,
        Yet in his reflection, self-discovery's aim.

        Through urban streets, he walks with grace,
        A journey inward, finding his own pace.
        Chelsea's whispers, a melody sweet,
        Yet in the silence, self-identity seeks retreat.

        A maze of questions, a puzzle unsolved,
        In the mirror of selfhood, he's evolved.
        Chelsea's heart beats in sync with his,
        Yet his own rhythm, a dance of self-bliss.

        As the moonlight spills on cobblestone streets,
        He grapples with shadows, where selfhood meets.
        Chelsea's love, a beacon in the night,
        Yet within himself, he seeks the light.

        In the tapestry of self, he weaves his story,
        Chelsea's love, a chapter of glory.
        Yet, before he surrenders to love's embrace,
        He must first decipher his own grace.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Deeper Shadows</h2>
      <p>In the realm of hearts, where emotions entwine,
        Joseph and Chelsea, a love quite divine.
        He cherishes her, like a rare, blooming rose,
        Yet within himself, a journey he chose.

        Through moonlit nights and sun-kissed days,
        Joseph's love for Chelsea forever stays.
        In the garden of affection, he tends to her bloom,
        But in the shadows, he senses impending gloom.

        With every touch, a promise whispered true,
        Yet his soul, a puzzle he must construe.
        In Chelsea's eyes, a universe he finds,
        Yet within himself, complexity binds.

        He longs to hold her, a tempest in his chest,
        But the path to self unfolds as a quest.
        Commitment to unravel what lies within,
        Joseph holds back, a struggle to begin.

        His love for Chelsea, an undying flame,
        Yet his own identity, he cannot tame.
        He yearns to walk alongside her, hand in hand,
        But the intricacies of self he must understand.

        In the echoes of their laughter and shared dreams,
        Joseph wrestles with internal streams.
        He loves her deeply, beyond measure,
        Yet fears leading her astray with uncertain treasure.

        For now, he treads with mindful grace,
        Balancing love's dance and self-embrace.
        In the tapestry of time, love and self align,
        As Joseph and Chelsea await a fate divine.</p>
